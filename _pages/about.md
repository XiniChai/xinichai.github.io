Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I'm Chai Xini. I graduated from Southeast University's School of Architecture in June 2025, with a major in [Smart Design and Advanced Construction](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/2022/0602/c9118a410612/page.htm). I researched the smart construction of prefabricated buildings under [Prof. Hong Zhang](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/zh/main.psp). I have a Bachelor's degree in Architecture from Hunan City University. After graduation, I worked at Shanghai [Yanfei Architecture Studio](https://www.yanfeiarchitects.com/) for four years, gaining experience in architectural design and project management.

My research focuses on intelligent construction of prefabricated buildings, BIM–Semantic Web integration, and computer vision for construction management. My email is chaixn@seu.edu.cn(or chaixini@126.com).
