Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I'm Chai Xini. I graduated from Southeast University's School of Architecture in June 2025, with a major in [Smart Design and Advanced Construction](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/2022/0602/c9118a410612/page.htm). I researched the smart construction of prefabricated buildings under [Prof. Hong Zhang](https://arch.seu.edu.cn/zh/main.psp). I have a Bachelor's degree in Architecture from Hunan City University. After graduation, I worked at Shanghai [Yanfei Architecture Studio](https://www.yanfeiarchitects.com/) for four years, gaining experience in architectural design and project management.

My research focuses on the intelligent design and construction of prefabricated buildings, encompassing computer vision, robot navigation, and positioning in construction and inspection, as well as enhancing robotic perception through the integration of BIM, semantic web, and visual systems.
